# About

**NanoVNA-H** and **NanoVNA-H4** are very tiny handheld Vector Network Analyzers (VNA).
They are standalone portable devices with LCD and battery.

NanoVNA-X is maintained by **@momentics** (https://github.com/momentics/) and optimised for the
memory-constrained STM32F072 and STM32F303 platforms. The codebase is a continuation of
the outstanding work by [@DiSlord](https://github.com/DiSlord/) and is ultimately derived
from the original firmware created by [@edy555](https://github.com/edy555). The firmware
continues to be distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL so that the original authors
retain their rights to their work.

This repository contains the source code of the improved NanoVNA-H and NanoVNA-H4 firmware
used in the NanoVNA-X project. The documentation describes the build and flash process on a
macOS or a Linux (Debian or Ubuntu) system, other Linux (or even BSD) systems may behave
similar.

## Architecture Overview

NanoVNA-X embraces a layered architecture that separates bootstrapping, platform
integration, measurement processing and the user interface so the firmware remains
maintainable while fitting into the tight flash and RAM budgets of the STM32F072 and
STM32F303 families.

* **Boot and application runtime.** The firmware starts in `src/core/main.c`, which hands off
  to `app_main()` so that all higher level wiring lives in `src/app/application.c`. That
  entry point initialises ChibiOS/RT, configures the USB console and synthesiser drivers,
  brings up the measurement pipeline, and spins a dedicated sweep thread that coordinates
  measurements, UI updates and shell commands.
* **Platform abstraction.** `src/platform/platform_hal.c` invokes the registered board driver
  table from `src/platform/boards/` so each supported target can publish a `PlatformDrivers`
  structure with its initialisation hooks and peripheral descriptors. This keeps the core
  application agnostic of whether it is running on the NanoVNA-H (STM32F072) or NanoVNA-H4
  (STM32F303) hardware variants.
* **Services layer.** Shared infrastructure lives in `src/services/`. The event bus implements
  a lightweight publish/subscribe mechanism used to announce sweep lifecycle events,
  configuration changes and other signals across modules. The scheduler provides a wrapper
  around ChibiOS threads for cooperative workers, while the configuration service is
  responsible for persisting user settings and calibration slots in MCU flash with checksum
  protection.
* **Measurement pipeline and DSP.** `src/measurement/pipeline.c` provides the façade that
  bridges platform drivers and the measurement routines inside `app/application.c`. It tracks
  which channels are active, executes sweep loops and exposes hooks for smoothing or domain
  transforms. Numerical helpers and calibration maths reside in `src/dsp/`, keeping
  compute-heavy code isolated from hardware access.
* **Drivers and middleware.** Low-level device interactions are implemented in `src/drivers/`
  for the LCD, Si5351 synthesiser, TLV320 codec and USB front-end, while `src/middleware/`
  houses small integration shims such as the `chprintf` binding for ChibiOS streams. Common
  third-party components (ChibiOS, FatFs) are vendored under `third_party/` and configured
  through the headers in `config/` and top-level `chconf.h`/`halconf.h`.
* **User interface layer.** The sweep thread initialises the UI toolkit (`src/ui/`), processes
  hardware inputs, refreshes plotting primitives and marks screen regions for redraw. Fonts
  and icon bitmaps that back the rendering code are stored in `src/resources/`. Optional
  feature modules, such as the embedded web browser under `src/modules/`, can subscribe to
  events or schedule tasks without changing the core loop.

Complementary headers live in `include/`, while board support files, linker scripts and
startup code reside in `boards/`. This structure lets the same measurement and UI engines run
across both memory profiles with only targeted platform overrides.

## Hardware platform and used chips
The primary target MCUs are the STM32F072xB and STM32F303 (NanoVNA-H/H4); the F072 board employs an 8 MHz crystal, USB, SPI, I²C, and I²S lines for the display, SD, codec, and touch sensor, as described in board.h.

The Si5351A clock generator (or a compatible part) drives the RF synthesizers and also produces reference frequencies for the audio ADC; its driver implements frequency caching, power management, and PLL initialization over I²C.

The TLV320AIC3204 acts as a dual-channel audio ADC/DAC (I²S), with PLL configuration and input routing; the firmware controls it via I²C and streams the working data over SPI/I²S.

Display controllers ILI9341/ST7789 (320×240) and ST7796S (480×320) are selected per board; DMA is supported, along with brightness control (for the H4), inversion, and text shadows to improve readability.

Additional features include an RTC, SD card (screenshots, firmware, file manager), USB UID, remote control, and a measurement module (LC matching, cable analysis, and resonance analysis).

## Building the firmware

NanoVNA-X uses a standard GNU Make workflow and the Arm GNU GCC toolchain.
See [`doc/building.md`](doc/building.md) for a fully detailed guide; the
Russian translation is available in [`doc/building_ru.md`](doc/building_ru.md).
summary below outlines the essential steps for a clean build.

### 1. Install the cross-compiler

Recent versions of `gcc-arm-none-eabi` are supported; there is no need to rely
on archived releases.

#### macOS (Homebrew)

```
brew install gcc-arm-none-eabi dfu-util
```

#### Ubuntu / Debian

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi dfu-util
```

After installation confirm that the compiler is available:

```
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```

### 2. Fetch the source code

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/momentics/NanoVNA-X.git
cd NanoVNA-X
```

Updating to the latest revision later only requires `git pull`.

### 3. Build the desired firmware profile

Set the `TARGET` environment variable to select the board and invoke `make`.
Use `make clean` when switching between targets to avoid mixing artefacts.

```
export TARGET=F072   # NanoVNA-H (default)
make clean
make -j$(nproc)
```

For the NanoVNA-H4 firmware build, set `TARGET=F303`. Build outputs are written
to `build/` (`H.bin`/`H4.bin`, `.elf`, `.hex`). See [doc/building.md](doc/building.md)
for a breakdown of which artefact to use with DFU, SWD, or debugging tools.

### 4. Flash the firmware

Place the device into DFU mode using one of the following methods:

* Open the device and jumper `BOOT0` pin to `Vdd` when powering the device.
* Select menu Config → DFU (requires recent firmware).
* Press the jog switch on your H4 while powering the device.

Then flash the binary generated in the previous step:

```
export TARGET=F072
make flash
```

`make flash` uses `dfu-util` under the hood and will upload the matching
`build/H.bin` or `build/H4.bin` artefact for the selected target. `dfu-util`
prints status diagnostics such as a transient "firmware is corrupt" warning
while switching the device out of DFU mode; the build script clears the status
automatically and the message can be ignored.

## Companion Tools

There are several numbers of great companion PC tools from third-party.
